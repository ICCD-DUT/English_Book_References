## Introduce
**************************
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the realms of computer graphics and computer vision, we commonly utilize images to describe objects or scenes. However, in structural representation, 3D models offer a more intricate portrayal of local intricacies and formations compared to 2D images. A comprehensive 3D model can circumvent issues like self-occlusion and structural gaps in 2D images, thereby enhancing the precision of other visual tasks such as object recognition and segmentation. It is evident that, in comparison to images, 3D models possess robust expressive capabilities and hold an indispensable role in domains like robot navigation, interaction, and data visualization.
