# 3D Scene Modeling and Robotics Interaction - Related Resources
**************************
## Introduction
**************************
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book consists of 6 chapters. Chapters 1 to 3 comprehensively introduce the development and application of scene modeling and understanding technology, including 3D reconstruction, scene exploration, and scene understanding. Chapter 1 introduces 3D reconstruction algorithms based on traditional multi-view geometry and deep learning, discussing how to recover 3D structure from images; Chapter 2 introduces scene exploration algorithms in 3D reconstruction and visual semantic navigation, discussing different ways to explore unknown scenes; Chapter 3 introduces two types of indoor scene understanding algorithms based on object detection and classification and scene graphs, discussing different ways of scene understanding from the two levels of unstructured and structured scene knowledge. Chapters 4 and 5 comprehensively introduce the development and application of robot perception technology, including visual relocation and robot navigation, obstacle avoidance, grasping, etc. Chapter 4 introduces classic and deep learning-based algorithms related to visual relocalization, navigation and obstacle avoidance, discussing how robots acquire their own pose status and complete navigation and obstacle avoidance tasks;Chapter 5 introduces analytical methods, empirical methods, and deep learning-based algorithms for robot grasping, discussing different grasping posture detection and robot grasping methods. Chapter 6 focuses on comprehensive project practice with 3D scene modeling and understanding for robot tasks as an example, which is convenient for readers to comprehensively understand and master theory and practice. The content of this book, except for Chapter 6, each chapter corresponds to a fixed theme, in which the theory and practice parts are interspersed. In each chapter, the theme is first outlined, the main research work at home and abroad is discussed around this theme, and different technologies are explained according to different methods. The explanation of technology is mainly practical, combined with theoretical knowledge in practice, and "chapter knowledge points" and other characteristic content are designed to facilitate readers to deepen their understanding; each technology includes task description, related work, technical methods, results presentation and summary, etc. The relevant content materials (algorithm code, related papers, etc.) of this book are attached in the form of QR code links in each chapter.
