&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scene understanding has always been a focus in computer vision. When a robot enters an unfamiliar scene, its primary task is to understand and recognize the real environment, which requires the robot to have the ability to parse visual scenes and effectively perceive, understand, and interpret the content in the scene.
