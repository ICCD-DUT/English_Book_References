## Introduce
**************************
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligent service robots are identified as a frontier technology to be developed over the next 15 years in the "National Medium and Long-term Science and Technology Development Plan (2006-2020)." In 2012, China formulated the "Twelfth Five-Year Plan for the Development of Service Robot Technology" to support the growth of the robot industry. The application scenarios for robots in real life are becoming increasingly diverse, with autonomous grasping being an essential function for robots to interact with the real world. Whether for industrial robots on assembly lines or service robots in stores and homes, autonomous grasping is crucial for object interaction.
